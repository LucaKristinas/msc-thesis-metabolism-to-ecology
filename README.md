</p>

This project integrates a hybrid framework that bridges constraint-based metabolic models (FBA) 
and consumer–resource models using elementary flux vectors (EFVs). With *E. coli* as a case study, 
we show how EFVs informed by molecular noise improve predictions of flux distributions, growth, 
and nutrient dynamics.

This repository contains the code, data, and environment configuration for this project.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

To reproduce the analyses and run the code in this repository, we recommend using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/).

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LucaKristinas/msc-thesis-metabolism-to-ecology.git
cd /msc-thesis-metabolism-to-ecology
```

### 2. Create the environment
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### 3. Activate the environment
```bash
conda activate met_to_eco_env
```

## ▶️ Running Analyses

Once the environment is active, analyses can be reproduced by running the scripts inside the `code/` directory. Each subfolder contains scripts for a different part of the project:
 
- **`code/Ideal_Microbes_Benchmarking/`** → benchmarking the *Ideal Microbes* framework.  
- **`code/Ideal_Microbes_Simulations/`** → simulations using the *Ideal Microbes* package.  
  > **Note:** These analyses can only be run once the package associated with the manuscript  
  *“Metabolic Ecology of Microbes: From Metabolic Networks to Growth Laws and Population Dynamics”* (V. Piskovsky, L. Schnepp-Pesch, and K. Foster; status as of September 2025: in preparation for submission) is publicly available.  
- **`code/Mplrs_Analysis/`** → mode enumeration with `mplrs` and scalability analysis.  
- **`code/GEM_Reduction/`** → idea(s) for genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) reduction.
