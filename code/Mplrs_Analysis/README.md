# üìÅ mplrs Analysis

This folder contains the analysis and quantitative evaluation of the **mplrs** algorithm‚Äîa scalable, parallelized C wrapper for the **lrs** vertex enumeration algorithm, developed by David Avis and adapted by Skip Jordan. `mplrs` enables distributed computation across multicore machines via MPI, making it highly suitable for high-performance computing (HPC) environments.

In this project, `mplrs` is used in combination with the **EFMlrs** Python package to enumerate **elementary flux modes (EFMs)** and **elementary flux vectors (EFVs)** in metabolic networks. This complements the analyses in:

* **Buchner & Zanghellini (2021)**: *EFMlrs: a Python package for elementary flux mode enumeration via lexicographic reverse search*. *BMC Bioinformatics* 22:1‚Äì21.
* **Avis & Jordan (2018)**: *mplrs: A scalable parallel vertex/facet enumeration code*. *Math. Prog. Comp.* 10:267‚Äì302. [https://doi.org/10.1007/s12532-017-0129-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12532-017-0129-y)

By applying these tools to models of increasing complexity, this analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the practical limitations of EFV enumeration in metabolic modelling and highlights current computational boundaries.
